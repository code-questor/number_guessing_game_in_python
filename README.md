Number guessing app in Python

I created a simple number guessing game in python to utilize my python skills.

A small app window will open once you run the program and ask you to input a number.

If you are closer to the number it'll show "Hot", if very very far, it'll show "Cold!", and if it's in between, it'll show "Warm!".

A fairly simple program that utilizes random number generator and matching with the user's input number. 

There are no limitations in terms of tries.

Once finished, it'll show how many tries it took for the user to guess the game.
